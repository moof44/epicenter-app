# Epicenter: Community Event & Check-in Hub

## Overview

Epicenter is a dynamic, real-time dashboard for community events and member check-ins. It provides a visually engaging way to track event trends, monitor attendance, and celebrate member engagement. The application will be built with the latest Angular features, prioritizing a reactive architecture, a beautiful user interface, and a seamless user experience.

## Style, Design, and Features

This section will be updated as the application is developed.

## Current Plan: Phase 1 - Project Setup & Core Structure

- **Objective**: Establish the foundational structure of the application, including the core layout, routing, and initial styling.
- **Steps**:
  1.  **Generate Core Components**: Create a `LayoutComponent` to act as the main application shell, along with `HeaderComponent` and `FooterComponent` for consistent UI elements.
  2.  **Establish Visual Identity**: Define a modern color palette, typography (using Google Fonts), and base styles in `src/styles.css`.
  3.  **Implement Layout**: Integrate the new components into the `AppComponent` and set up the main router outlet within the `LayoutComponent`.
  4.  **Create Dashboard Route**: Generate a `DashboardComponent` and configure it as the default route, which will serve as the main landing page.
  5.  **Verification**: Run `ng build` to ensure all initial changes compile correctly and the foundation is solid.
